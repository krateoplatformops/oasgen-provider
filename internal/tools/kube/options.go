	// field that the decoder encounters. This is the default behavior
	// prior to v1.23.
	// - Warn: This will send a warning via the standard warning response
	// header for each unknown field that is dropped from the object, and
	// for each duplicate field that is encountered. The request will
	// still succeed if there are no other errors, and will only persist
	// the last of any duplicate fields. This is the default in v1.23+
	// - Strict: This will fail the request with a BadRequest error if
	// any unknown fields would be dropped from the object, or if any
	// duplicate fields are present. The error returned from the server
	// will contain all unknown and duplicate fields encountered.
