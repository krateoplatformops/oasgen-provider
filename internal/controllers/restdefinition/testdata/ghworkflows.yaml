          summary: Create a workflow dispatch event
          description: |-
            You can use this endpoint to manually trigger a GitHub Actions workflow run. You can replace `workflow_id` with the workflow file name. For example, you could use `main.yaml`.

            You must configure your GitHub Actions workflow to run when the [`workflow_dispatch` webhook](/developers/webhooks-and-events/webhook-events-and-payloads#workflow_dispatch) event occurs. The `inputs` are configured in the workflow file. For more information about how to configure the `workflow_dispatch` event in the workflow file, see "[Events that trigger workflows](/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows#workflow_dispatch)."

            OAuth tokens and personal access tokens (classic) need the `repo` scope to use this endpoint.
